AI Chat App with AWS Cognito
Hi, this is the assignment.

An .env file will be provided to you.

Requirements:
Backend: Node.js 14.17.6
MongoDB
Once installed, run npm run dev in both the backend and frontend.

Please note that the code structuring might not be optimal due to time constraints. Some types are any due to lack of time as well. The history object isn't being used as the documentation is unclear.

Frontend Paths:
/home: Home of the app (no authentication required).
/login: Login page with unique username and password.
/register: Register page using email and verification code from AWS Cognito.
/chat: Chat with the AI, limited to 25 chats per user.
WebSocket (ws) is protected under the Express app. Thank you!
